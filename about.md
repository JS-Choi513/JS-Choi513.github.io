## Welcome :bow:

Somehow, someway you've found yourself here. 

Where is here?

This is personal blog. Probably unfit for consumption, but don't let that stop you.

## About me :eyes:
I am a M.S. course student studying computer engineering in South Korea.

Currently interested in **computer systems, machine learning acceleration, and cloud computing**.

Feel free to check out my C.V. and social profiles for more details.

Yes. My name is Jinseo Choi.

## You can find... :mag_right:


Some mess of my thoughts and trace of struggle about my works.

#### What having a blog does for me: 
* Organize my thought and knowledge (_It maybe unorganized sometimes_).
   * By taking the time to post content here, it lets the little gears in my head chew on particular thoughts.
* Technical document things I have interested in.
* Recording footprint of my M.S. course.
* Improving longer term retention of knowledge.
* Somthing whatever I want to write(news letters, memes, etc.)

With this in mind, my main target audience is, well, _myself_.  If you've found _yourself_ here by some means, you are
definitely welcome to stay and make yourself at home. You'll have to pardon some terrible grammar and spelling at times, 
because I don't invest a lot in those areas here. But, if there is something useful to you, then great... if not, go
google it and see where it leads.

**Of course, pointing out any misinformation about the post is welecome anytime!**
